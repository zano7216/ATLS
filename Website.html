    This assignment was pretty straightforward and only took a few attempts. I've heard HTML can be harder the more that you add to a webpage but this was a very simple start :D
    The most difficult part was getting the link to work in the Github file and making saves/revisions to the code and then reuploading to Github.
    Overall was not hard and the Assignment docx was a very useful step-by-step instruction.
